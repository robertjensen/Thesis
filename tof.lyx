 Since this has proven to be such a useful addition to the setup, I have

 The frame and the pumps for the system was scavenged from an old molecular

 At this point in time, we have not tried to bake the chamber and this means
 we have a rather poor background pressure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-9}\,$
\end_inset

mbar in both the source region and flight tube.
 However, it will eventually make sense to actually bake the chamber to
 bring down background pressure since the background pressure contributes
 with dead-counts on the detector and thus degrades the signal to noise
 ratio of the instrument.
 All parts of the setup are fully UHV compatible and since we have quite
 good pumping capacity, it is to be expected that we can get well below
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-10}\,$

mbar once the chamber is properly baked.

 Detectors are positioned both at the end of the flight tube (behind the

 are detected when the reflectron is in use.

The source region is where the ions enter the instrument and where they
 are accelerated.
 The ions enter from the top of drawing, that is, orthogonal to the flight
 direction.
 On the way into the acceleration region, ions will pass through a number
 of einzel lenses to focus the them as well as possible.
 At a given point in time, a high voltage pulse on the acceleration plate
 will accelerate the ions away from the source region and into the acceleration
 region where the ions are further accelerated up to the final drift velocity.
 Typical values for the acceleration is 400--800
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V and typical drift energy is on the order of 2000
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V.
 Of course it is critical that the rise time of the acceleration pulse is
 as short as possible, in our case it is on the order of SLÃ… TALLET OP!!
 From the acceleration region, the ions enter another set of focusing lenses
 as well as the deflector which is designed to compensate for the initial
 drift velocity orthogonal to the flight direction and will ideally ensure
 that the ions proceeds into the flight tube in an angle of 
\begin_inset Formula $7^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After entering the drift tube, the ions will float freely for almost a meter
 (37.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

inches to be exact) before they enter the reflectron.
 The flight tube consists of two concentric tubes, the outside tube is the
 leak-tight barrier to atmosphere that ensures that we can hold a vacuum
 in the chamber.
 However, since this tube is exposed to the outside world, it would be most
 inconvenient if this tube was held at -2000
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V, it would constitute a significant danger for operators as well as complicate
 the connection to other electronics significantly.
 This is where the second concentric tube, the so-called 'liner' enters
 the equation.
 This tube has a slightly smaller diameter than the outside tube and is
 mounted on small ceramic tubes that rests on the outside tube and ensures
 that the liner is electrically floating compared to the main chamber.
 The liner perforated at the position of the flight tube pump to ensure
 decent pumping of the liner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TOF can be operated in two ways, linear mode or reflectron mode.
 In linear mode all voltages on the reflectron is set to liner voltage.
 In this case, ions will continue straight trough the reflectron and hit
 a detector positioned in the end of the flight tube.
 This is the simplest mode of operation but it also performs far worse than
 the reflectron mode, partly because of the longer flight distance with
 the reflectron, but more importantly because of the focusing effect of
 the reflectron, which we will come back to in section

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the reflectron mode, suitable voltages are applied on grids in each end
 of the reflectron to ensure that ions are stopped and re-accelerated in
 the opposite direction where they will again enter the flight tube and
 because of the 
\begin_inset Formula $7^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 tilt of the ions, they will hit the second detector and not end up in the
 acceleration region once more.

Both detectors are Multi Channel Plates which is a rather sophisticated
 kind of electron multiplier.

 and is very flat within the entire area.
 This very large and flat detector area makes the detector very tolerant
 for ions having slightly different initial positions in the plane orthogonal
 to the flight directions, since the various ions would make almost identical
 trajectories only slightly translated.
 The MCP consists of a large number (typically several thousands) of small
 channels coated with a material with low work function material.
 The MCP is heavily biased between the front side and the back side, creating
 a steep voltage gradient across the device.
 When ions hit the surface of the MCP, it will release a number of electrons
 which due to the high voltage gradient will accelerate further into the
 channel.
 Since each channel is very swallow, the electrons will only travel a short
 distance before they again hit the surface and releases even more electrons.
 In this way a single ion will be multiplies into a significant number of
 electrons, how many is heavily dependent on the voltage across the device.
 In our case, we have mounted a rather cheap MCP for the linear detection

 (!!) and a substantially better one, a so-called Z-gap detector, with a
 maximum bias of 5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

kV for the reflectron detection.
 Interestingly, the detector is what ultimately sets the limit for the highest
 mass that can be detected.
 It turns out that for heavy ions the detection efficiency drops significantly
 with mass, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Krems2005"

\end_inset

, because the energy of the particle is distributed on a larger and larger
 area which increases the risk that the initial impact of the particle will
 not release a single electron that can be further multiplied.
 Since we are among other things also interested in measuring on metal clusters,
 a high mass limit is essential.
 The current Z-gap detector has a nominal maximal detectable mass of 5000

, one could easily get the idea that all the interesting stuff happens inside
 the vacuum chamber.
 However, nothing could be more wrong, in reality much of the magic of the
 instrument takes place outside of the chamber in the rather substantial
 amount of electronics that drives the instrument.
 First of all, it turns out that one needs quite a lot of power supplies,
 not only do we need high voltages for the liner potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{liner}$
\end_inset

, also the focus lens, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{focus}$
\end_inset

, the deflection plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{def}$
\end_inset

, the acceleration plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{pulse}$
\end_inset

, two reflectron voltages, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R2}$
\end_inset

 as well as the MCP detector, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}$
\end_inset

, needs high voltages, all in the range of -4000 -- +4000
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V.
 Additionally the four entrance lenses needs a total of five different voltages
 (one lens also acts as a deflector and thus is in two parts).
 For one thing this means that we need quite a lot of power supplies, but
 this is a minor problem, most of the voltages can be supplied by two multi-outp
ut supplies, since none of the components uses significant amounts of power.
 However, it is also evident that optimizing the system is not especially
 fun, since the parameter space is extremely large.
 Luckily it turns out that the entrance lenses can be optimized almost independe
nt of the rest of the system, reducing the problem from an 11-dimensional
 problem to a five-dimensional problem and a six-dimensional problem.
 This is however still quite a lot and the initial tuning, just to get a
 measureble signal, proved to be somewhat of a challenge.
 In this situation, it is highly recommended to operate the instrument in
 linear mode since this takes out another to dimensions of the initial optimizat
ion problem.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ionization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parts bought from Jordan of course constitutes the actual analytic instrumen
ts and is what is known as a Orthogonal Acceleration TOF which means that
 the ions to be measured enters the acceleration region orthogonal to the
 direction of flight.
 This is especially well suited to measure on externally generated ions,
 which is actually not what we have when measuring on the microreactors,
 the output from the capillary is obviously not ionized when leaving the
 reactor.
 However, the reason for choosing this type of instrument is, that we originally
 expected to used the TOF as a characterization tool for the two cluster
 source at the department, and these instrument actually do have an ionized
 output.
 This little experimental detail means, that we had to build our own ionization
 source to be able to use the instrument at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimally all ions will enter with very low energy orthogonal to the flight
 direction, zero energy in the drift direction and perfectly centered between
 the acceleration plate and the grounded grid immediately to the right.
 Of course the ions will not have ideal position and energy, which will
 ultimately set the limit of the resolution of the instrument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our current way of ionization is both very simple, very cheap and very much
 sub-optimal.
 Originally we only wanted to make a very primitive and cheap ionization
 source to able to test the instrument by letting in a gas directly from
 a leak valve, simply just to able to tune and optimize the instrument before
 mounting it on the cluster source.
 For this purpose we realized the classic UHV Bayard-Alpert ion gauge
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BAYARD1950"

\end_inset

 might be a simple and working solution.
 After all the gauge works by ionizing gas, however in the normal operation
 mode, no ions will leave the gauge, rather they will be neutralized when
 they hit the collector and leave the gauge as non-ionized molecules.
 However, by removing the lid of the gauge and short-circuiting it to the
 grid voltage, the ions will now drift be able to escape the gauge through
 the top where the lid is now missing.
 Using this configuration approximately half of the ionized ions are expected
 to leave the ionization gauge

 A current of approximately 3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

A is run through the filament resulting in an emission current somewhere
 between 1 and 10,mA, in our current configuration we are not actively stabilizi
ng the emission current, and we are typically not measuring it either.
 Fixing this is very high on the to-do list since the emission current is
 most likely not especially stable which of course is very bad for the self-cons
istency of the measurements.
 The grid is biased approximately 40
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

 the filament towards the grid.
 This energy is very much a compromise, since for optimal ionization we
 would like much higher energies

, the ionization cross section for most relevant species will peak between
 100 and 150
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

eV.
 Typically ionization gauges operate in the range of 120--150
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V for exactly this reason
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However, high ion energy is exactly the opposite of what we want for an
 ion source for the TOF, where we would optimally want mono-energetic ions
 of approximately 5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

eV.
 It is evident that the difference between optimal ionization and optimal
 performance of the TOF is very large and the fact that it can be brought
 to work at all is actually quite unintuitive.
 The entire construction is placed in a flange with a small orifice which
 is differentially pumped by a turbo pump.
 Large amounts of gas can hence be dosed locally around the ion gauge while
 still maintaining a low pressure in the source region of the TOF-MS.
 The small orifice is essential in the setup to avoid high pressure in the
 acceleration region and drift tube of the TOF-MS which would cause an increase
 in dead counts on the MCP thus decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of
 the recorded signal.

\begin_layout Section
Examples of operation

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, we cannot judge instruments only on the coolness factor,
 they also need to deliver actual results to merit a position in the lab.
 Fortunately the performance of the TOF is very good, the resolution is
 much better than a traditional QMS, the manufacturer of our device claims
 resolutions of up to 
\begin_inset Formula $m/\Delta m\approx4000$
\end_inset

 is possible under optimal conditions.
 Unfortunately we are working far from optimal conditions, primarily due
 to our very primitive ion source which produces too few ions of too high
 energy with a too large energy spread.

Since the TOF-MS only measures flight time and not the actual mass of the
 measured molecules or atoms it is necessary to determine the relationship
 between flight time and actual mass.
 This can be done by recognizing known pattern in a mass spectrum, this
 could be water at mass
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

18, CO at mass
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

28 and CO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 at mass 44, and then use the measured flight times of these 'known' masses
 to fit an expression for the flight time as a function of mass.
 This approach is in some cases adequate but does have the significant drawback
 that several peaks of well known masses must be present in the flight spectrum
 which is not always necessarily feasible.
 To determine the relationship between mass and flight time we have made
 a numeric model of the mass spectrometer which calculates the flight time
 based only on the voltages for the pulser, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{P}$
\end_inset

, liner, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{L}$
\end_inset

, and reflectron, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R2}$
\end_inset

, and thus provides a relationship of flight time to mass.
 The model is implemented as a very simple 1D iterative solution of the
 equation of motion of an ion initially positioned at an arbitrary position
 in the acceleration region.
 All measurements are based on the CAD-drawings as supplied by Jordan Instrument
s.
 A single free parameter, in the form of a correction to the length of the
 flight tube is allowed to be fitted to minimize systematic error.
 This free parameter turns out to be as small as 4.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm which actually fits rather well with the added length from the copper
 gaskets not included in the CAD-drawings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, the model is used together with the experimental determination
 of a single mass since this will help fix the unknown delays originating
 from the measurement trigger, rise time of the high-voltage pulse at the
 repeller plate and cable delays.

An interesting side effect of the model is that besides predicting the expected
 flight times for a given particle, it will also plot the trajectory of
 a given ion on its way trough the flight tube.
 This means that it can be used to illustrate various concepts of the instrument.

 In figure~
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulated_reflectron"

\end_inset

 it is illustrated how the reflectron improves the resolution of the Time
 Of Flight instrument.
 The point is, that in the real world, ions are not ideally positioned in
 the center of the acceleration region, some ions will be very close to
 the acceleration plate and some will be close to the ground grid.
 Ions starting exactly at the center will eventually reach a drift energy
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{drift}=Z_{e}\left(V_{L}+V_{P}/2\right)$
\end_inset

, ions initially closer to the acceleration plate will be faster, ions closer
 to the ground grid will be slower.
 This spread in energy inherently limits the resolution of a linear Time
 Of Flight instrument.
 However, as can be seen in figure~
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulated_reflectron"

\end_inset

, if the voltages on the reflectron is chosen correctly, the reflectron
 will act as a focusing lens where the faster ions will dig deeper into
 the reflectron than the slower ions and thus compensate for the increased
 speed.
 The task for the constructor of is instrument is now to position the MCP
 in the focus point of the reflectron, which is exactly the case in our
 instrument.

Since the TOF was not originally constructed for the microreactor system,
 we did not have a long list of experiments to perform with this new piece
 of equipment.
 Rather the situation was the opposite, suddenly we had access to an unexpected
 device and suddenly we had to think of relevant applications for it.
 Rather soon we came up with two applications, benzene hydrogenation and
 ammonia oxidation.
 The benzene hydrogenation is in a very early state and the results presented
 here are highly preliminary.
 On the ammonia oxidation we have quite a lot of results and this will be
 thoroughly covered in the masters thesis of Mathias

 and here I will just show a few selected results showing the advantages
 of time-of-flight mass spectrometry for this reaction.

Benzene Hydrogenation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a vacuum physicist, Benzene is a frightening compound.
 Just the fact that it contains ns no less than 12 atoms (C
\begin_inset Formula $_{6}$
\end_inset

H
\begin_inset Formula $_{6}$
\end_inset

) is certainly enough to complicate turn a typical nice and clean mass-spectrum
 into a forest of peaks on a number of very non-typical masses, the number
 of ways for benzene to crack on a filament is large
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "nist-benzene"

\end_inset

, and adding isotopic effect on top of this does not help the situation.
 The total mass of 78
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

amu is also a complication in itself.
 Even though most mass spectrometers are able to operate up to 100
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

amu, the sensitivity is typically both poor and not especially well known
 at masses much over 50
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

amu.
 The TOF will not solve all these problems, the cracking pattern is still
 complicated, but at least it any sign of problems with the mass range is
 completely eliminated.
 Also the very high resolution is a great help since it completely eliminates
 cross talk between adjacent masses which can easily become a problem in
 a QMS, especially when the number of peaks in the mass spectrum is as high
 as in the case of benzene.

 the result of the benzene hydrogenation is shown.
 It turned out, that Pt catalyst was able to fully hydrogenate the Benzene
 into Cyclohexane even at room temperature.
 In principle we should be able to cool the sample enough to be able to
 actually measure the activation energy, but due to time constraints we
 chose to simply remove the hydrogen from the mixture which of course is
 also an efficient way of stopping the reaction.

.
 Here we tried to relate the activity of Pt nanoparticles to the cluster
 size.
 The result of this study is thourougly documented in the masters thesis
 by Mathis KjÃ¦rgaard Christensen and here I will mostly focus on the new
 abilities the TOF-instrument has provided for this kind of project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case we want to use the TOF in a time-resolved way much like a tradition
al QMS.
 This means that one needs to take many TOF spectrums at a high repetition
 rate.
 This has the great advantage that one does not have to chose which masses
 to follow, instead the complete spectrum is aquired for each repetition,
 the negative corraly of this is, that the measurements takes up quite large
 amounts of storage space.
 In this mode of operation it is almost impossble to real-time data analysis,
 espically not if the spectrum contains overlapping peaks, which would of
 course often be the case in situation where it would be interesting to
 prefer the TOF over the QMS.
 What we do instead is to simply blindly record the data (which is what
 we typically do anyway, since almost all measurement runs unattended) and
 then treat the data after the experiment is finished.

The way the data is treated is to chose a list of wanted masses and then
 do the procedure of gaussion fits as shown in figure

 for each mass for each recorded spectrum.
 These 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100--1000$
\end_inset

 gaussian fits can be performed using a simple Python program in a very
 short time.
 Of course one need to make sure that all the fits are performed correctly,
 and this is ensured by producing a pdf-file containing all the fits which
 can easily be inspected for fitting errors.

 Once all the gaussian fits are performed, it is an easy matter to plot
 the data in the same many that one would present data from a QMS.
