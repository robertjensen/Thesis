 Since this has proven to be such a useful addition to the setup, I have
 chosen to dedicate a chapter to this technique.

 The frame and the pumps for the system was scavenged from an old molecular

 At this point in time, we have not tried to bake the chamber and this means
 we have a rather poor background pressure of

mbar in both the source region and flight tube.
 However, it will make good sense to actually bake the chamber to bring
 down background pressure since the background pressure contributes with
 dead-counts on the detector and thus degrades the signal to noise ratio
 of the instrument.
 All parts of the setup are fully UHV compatible and since we have quite
 good pumping capacity, it is to be expected that we can get well below

mbar once the chamber is properly baked.

The instruments consists of three main regions.
 The entrance and acceleration region, the field free drift region, and
 the reflectron.
 Detectors are positioned both at the end of the flight tube (behind the
 reflectron) and at the 'beginning' of the flight tube, which is where ions
 are detected when the reflectron is in use.

The source region is where the ions enter the instrument and where they
 are accelerated.
 The ions enter from the top of drawing, that is, orthogonal to the flight
 direction.
 On the way into the acceleration region, ions will pass through a number
 of einzel lenses to focus the them as well as possible.
 At a given point in time, a high voltage pulse on the acceleration plate
 will accelerate the ions away from the source region and into the acceleration
 region where the ions are further accelerated up to the final drift velocity.
 Typical values for the acceleration is 400--800
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V and typical drift energy is on the order of 2000
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V.
 Of course it is critical that the rise time of the acceleration pulse is
 as short as possible, in our case it is on the order of SLÃ… TALLET OP!!
 From the acceleration region, the ions enter another set of focusing lenses
 as well as the deflector which is designed to compensate for the initial
 drift velocity orthogonal to the flight direction and will ideally ensure
 that the ions proceeds into the flight tube in an angle of 
\begin_inset Formula $7^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After entering the drift tube, the ions will float freely for almost a meter
 (37.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

inches to be exact) before they enter the reflectron.
 The flight tube consists of two concentric tubes, the outside tube is the
 leak-tight barrier to atmosphere that ensures that we can hold a vacuum
 in the chamber.
 However, since this tube is exposed to the outside world, it would be most
 inconvinient if this tube was held at -2000
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V, it would consitute a significant danger for operators as well as complicate
 the connection to other electroncs significantly.
 This is where the second concentric tube, the so-called 'liner' enters
 the equation.
 This tube has a slightly smaller diameter than the outside tube and is
 mounted on small cheramic tubes that rests on the outside tube and ensures
 that the liner is electrically floating compared to the main chamber.
 The liner perforated at the position of the flight tube pump to ensure
 decent pumping of the liner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TOF can be operated in two ways, linear mode or reflectron mode.
 In linear mode all voltages on the reflectron is set to liner voltage.
 In this case, ions will continue straight trough the reflectron and hit
 a detector positioned in the end of the flight tube.
 This is the simplest mode of operation but it also performs far worse than
 the reflectron mode, partly because of the longer flight distance with
 the reflectron, but more importantly because of the focusing effect of
 the reflectron, which we will come back to in section

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the reflectron mode, suitable voltages are applied on grids in each end
 of the reflectron to ensure that ions are stopped and re-accelerated in
 the opposite direction where they will again enter the flight tube and
 because of the 
\begin_inset Formula $7^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 tilt of the ions, they will hit the second detector and not end up in the
 acceleration region once more.

Both detectors are Multi Channel Plates which is a rather sophisticated
 kind of electron multiplier.
 The detector is has an area of approximately 10

 and is very flat within the entire area.
 This very large and flat detector area makes the detector very tollerant
 for ions having sligtly different initial positions in the plane orthogonal
 to the flight directions, since the various ions would make almost identical
 trajectories only sligtly translated.
 The MCP consists of a large number (typically several thousands) of small
 channels coated with a material with low work function material.
 The MCP is heavily biased between the front side and the back side, creating
 a steep voltage gradient across the device.
 When ions hit the surface of the MCP, it will release a number of electrons
 which due to the high voltage gradient will accelerate further into the
 channel.
 Since each channel is very swallow, the electrons will only travel a short
 distance before they again hit the surface and releases even more electrons.
 In this way a single ion will be multiplies into a significant number of
 electrons, how many is heavily dependant on the voltage across the device.
 In our case, we have mounted a rather cheap MCP for the linear detection

 (!!) and a substatially better one, a so-called Z-gap detector, with a
 maximum bias of 5

kV for the reflectron detection.
 Interestingly, the detector is what ultimately sets the limit for the highest
 mass that can be detected.
 It turns out that for heavy ions the detection efficiency drops significantly
 with mass, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, because the energy of the particle is distributed on a larger and larger
 area which increases the risk that the inital impact of the particle will
 not release a single electron that can be further multipled.
 Since we are among other things also interested in measuring on metal clusters,
 a high mass limit is essential.
 The current Z-gap detector has a nominal maximal detectable mass of 5000

, one coulde easily get the idea that all the interesting stuff happens
 inside the vacuum chamber.
 However, nothing could be more wrong, in reallity much of the magic of
 the instrument takes place outside of the chamber in the rather substantial
 amount of electronics that drives the instrument.
 First of all, it turns out that one needs quite a lot of power supplies,
 not only do we need high voltages for the liner potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{liner}$
\end_inset

, also the focus lens, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{focus}$
\end_inset

, the deflection plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{def}$
\end_inset

, the acceleration plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{pulse}$
\end_inset

, two reflectron voltages, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R2}$
\end_inset

 as well as the MCP detector, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}$
\end_inset

, needs high voltages, all in the range of -4000--4000
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

V.
 Additionally the four entrance lenses needs a total of five different voltages
 (on lense also acts as a deflector and thus is in two parts).
 For one thing this means that we need quite a lot of power supplies, but
 this is a minor problem, most of the voltages can be supplied by two power
 multi-output supplies, since none of the components uses significant amounts
 of power.
 However, it is also evident that optimizing the system is not espicially
 fun, since the parameter space is extremely large.
 Luckily it turns out that the entrance lenses can be optimized almost independe
nt of the rest of the system, reducing the problem from an 11-dimensional
 problem to a five-dimensional problem and a six-dimensional problem.
 This is however still quite a lot and the initial tuning just to get a
 signal proved to be somewhat of challenge.
 In this situation, it is highly recommended to operate the instrument in
 linear mode since this takes out another to dimensions of the initial optimizat
ion problem.

Ionization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parts bought from Jordan of course constitutes the actual analytic instrumen
ts and is what is known as a Orthogonal Acceleration TOF which means that
 the ions to be measured enters the acceleration region orthogonal to the
 direction of flight.
 This is especially well suited to measure on externally generated ions,
 which is actually not the case when measuring on the microreactors, the
 output from the capillary is obviously not ionized when leaving the reactor.
 However, the reason for choosing this type of instrument is, that we originally
 expected to used the TOF as a characterization tool for the two cluster
 source at the department, and these instrument actually do have an ionized
 output.
 This little experimental detail means, that we had to build our own ionization
 source to be able to use the instrument at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimally all ions will enter with very low energy orthorgonal to the flight
 direction, zero energy in the drift direction and perfectly centered between
 the acceleration plate and the grounded grid imidieatly to the right.
 Of course the ions will not have ideal positon and energy, which will ultimatel
y set the limit of the resolution of the instrument.

Unfortunately, we cannot judge instruments only on the coolnes factor, they
 also need to deliver actual results to merrit a position in the lab.
 Fortunately the performance of the TOF is very good, the resolution is
 much better than a traditional QMS....

\begin_layout Standard
Since the TOF-MS only measures flight time and not the actual mass of the
 measured molecules or atoms it is necessary to determine the relationship
 between flight time and actual mass.
 This can be done by recognizing known pattern in a mass spectrum, this
 could be water at mass
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

18, CO at mass
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

28 and CO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 at mass 44, and then use the measured flight times of these 'known' masses
 to fit an expression for the flight time as a function of mass.
 This approach is in some cases adequate but does have the significant drawback
 that several peaks of well known masses must be present in the flight spectrum
 which is not always necessarily feasible.
 To determine the relationship between mass and flight time we have made
 a numeric model of the mass spectrometer which calculates the flight time
 based only on the voltages for the pulser, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{P}$
\end_inset

, liner, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{L}$
\end_inset

, and reflectron, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{R2}$
\end_inset

, and thus provides a relationship of flight time to mass.
 The model is implemented as a very simple 1D iterative solution of the
 equation of motion of an ion initially positioned at an arbitrary position
 in the acceleration region.
 All measurements are based on the CAD-drawings as supplied by Jordan Instrument
s.
 A single free parameter, in the form of a correction to the length of the
 flight tube) is allowed to be fitted to minimize systematic error.
 This free parameter turns out to be as small as 4.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm which actually fits rather well with the added length from the cupper
 gaskets not included in the CAD-drawings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, the model is used together with the experimental determination
 of a single mass since this will help fix the unknown delays originating
 from the measurement trigger, rise time of the high-voltage pulse at the
 repeller plate and cable delays.

An interesting side effect of the model is that besides predicting the expected
 flighttimes for a given particel, it will also plot the trajectory of a
 given ion on its way trough the flighttube.
 This means that it can used to illustrate various concepts of the instrument.

\end_inset

 In figure~
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulated_reflectron"

\end_inset

 it is illustrated how the reflectron improves the resolution of the Time
 Of Flight instrument.
 The point is, that in the real world, ions are not ideally positioned in
 the center of the acceleration region, some ions will be very close to
 the acceleration plate and some will be close to the ground grid.
 Ions starting exactly at the center will eventually reach a drift energy
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{drift}=Z_{e}\left(V_{L}+V_{P}/2\right)$
\end_inset

, ions initially closer to the accelration plate will be faster, ions closer
 to the ground grid will be slower.
 This spread in energy inherently limits the resolution of a linear Time
 Of Flight instrument.
 However, as can be seen in figure~
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulated_reflectron"

\end_inset

, if the voltages on the reflectron is chosen correctly, the reflectron
 will act as a focusing lens where the faster ions will dig deeper into
 the reflectron than the slower ions and thus compensate for the increased
 speed.
 The task for the constructor of is instrument is now to position the MCP
 in the focus point of the reflectrong, which is exactly the case in our
 instrument.
