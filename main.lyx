Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is the summary of my work on the microreactor platform.
 The concept of microreactors are presented and some of the experimental
 challenges are outlined.
 The various experimental issues regarding the platform is discussed and
 the actual implementation of three generations of the setup is discussed
 in detail.
 Since heating and temperature measurement is an extremly important point
 in heterogenous catalysis, an entire chapter is dedicated to this subject,
 three different types of heaters has been implemented and tested.
 It is shown how it is in principle possible to quantify the available amount
 of active catalys surface area by reacting of an adsorbed layer of oxygen
 with CO.
 Some results from the reactors are presented, in particular oscillating
 CO-oxidation on Pt nanoparticles are discussed, but also data from a sensitivit
y measurement is presented.
 Various methods of gaining insight into the reactor besides the normal
 quadropole mass spectrometer is discussed, in particaluar a chapter is
 devoted to the application of a Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometer on the
 setup.
 Finally the thesis contains an outlook of the possible future of the setup,
 several suggestions for improvements is discussed.
