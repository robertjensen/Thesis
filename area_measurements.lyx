\begin_layout Chapter
Measuring the Active Area of a Catalyst
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Very often when doing measurements in the microreactor, one will want to
 know the available active area of the catalyst.
 In some case it can be very simple, for instance when working with metal
 thin-films, in these cases the area is more or less equal to the geometric
 area of the film, unless the catalyst is not polluted with surface contaminants.
 In other cases, such if one wants to check if the catalyst is clean, or
 if the sample consists of nanoparticles, it is much less clear how to estimate
 the surface area.
 Often one will know how much catalyst was deposited, but how will we know,
 if the nanoparticles sintered or an attempt of cleaning has failed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classic UHV procedure for measuring surface area of a catalyst, is the
 TPD.
 The sample is exposed to a gas (typical CO) with subsequent heating of
 the sample.
 The amount of gas coming of the sample is a measure of the surface area.
 However, this method is not quite as well suited in the microreactors.
 We have tried to do TPDs and it certainly works, but sensitivity is rather
 poor.
 The problem is that in order to do a high-quality TPD you need really efficient
 pumping since only one gas species is involved, CO is dosed and CO is measured.
 In UHV this problem also exists but due to the generally very high pumping
 capacity of UHV chambers it is possible to bring down the CO background
 reasonably fast.
 In the microreactors we have long pieces of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{4}"$
\end_inset

 pipes which makes it difficult to eliminate the CO background after the
 dose.
 Thus one needs to do the TPD on this high background, with corresponding
 bad signal-to-noise or wait for a very long time, which is both inefficient
 and also includes the risk that some of CO might desorb while waiting unless
 the sample is cooled below room temperature.
 For all these reasons we wanted to find another method of area measurement,
 even if it means accepting the price of finding separate methods for each
 type of system.

The solution we are using so far, is developed for Pt and will most likely
 not work for most other systems, since it relies on the specific catalytic
 properties of Pt.
 The idea is to circumvent the background problem by measuring other masses
 than what is dosed.
 This of course means that the process must involve a step of catalytic
 conversion between the dosed species into a product of another mass.
 Since Pt is so remarkably efficient at oxidizing CO, we chose a titration-like
 procedure which in short looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dose oxygen

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
The oxygen dose (0.2

\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

) of oxygen on all free surface sites.
 This layer is very stable and will not desorb while the gas-phase oxygen
 is pumped and flushed away.
 In this way the QMS background is brought down significantly since we are
 now measuring on a species that was not explicitly dosed.
 However, the background is not totally eliminated since both CO and O
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 contributes with a background of CO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the mass-spec, however the signal to noise is much better than a pure
 TPD.
 In reality the procedure is somewhat more complicated than described here,
 since we also need to dose a carrier gas before the CO to ensure a proper
 flow from the reactor and into the capillary outlet, for this we typically
 use hellium.
 Also the hellium is used to flush away the oxygen after the initial dose
 since this is faster than just pumping on the long tubes, especially on
 the old setup where we can only pump the tubes through the outlet of the
 sample.
 The complete procedure for area measurement is plotted in figure

.
 The entire procedure is performed at 70
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C, in principle we can also run at room temperature, but since the conversion
 of adsorbed oxygen are much slower at this temperature, the slightly elevated
 temperature, significantly increases the signal to noise ratio.
 The actual choice of temperature is a compromise between higher temperature
 which improves the measurement but might at the same time change the area
 we want to measure by e.g.
 sintering.
 The current typical value of 70
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C seems to be a good compromise, signal is good and sintering is not expected
 to be relevant for Pt at this temperature

Of course to be usefull, the area measuements will also need to work on
 nano particle samples rather than just thin films.
 For this reason we have tested the procedure on several samples made on
 the cluster source.

The first sample On this sample, we first tried to run a few area measurements
 before doing any attempts at cleaning the sample.
 After this, the sample was subjected to a number of different treatments
 with two area measurements in between.

 and the result is actually quite interesting.
 First of all it is evident that the sample shows no active surface area
 at all right after deposition and bonding, only after cleaning in oxygen
 do we see a measureble area.
 After this we see an assymptoticly increasing which one would guess is
 more an effect of the cleaning cycles themselves than on the heat treatments
 in He and CO.
 Finally it is also evident that it is possible to adsorb more than a monolayer
 of oxygen on sample by heating a fairly clean sample in large amounts of
 oxygen, every area measurement imidiately after this treatment shows an
 unusually large area.
 A final important observation is that the reproducibility seems to be excellent
, the eight consequtive area measurements shows almost identical results.
 The actual value of the area measurement for what must be presumed to be
 a clean sample is 102
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

nC which is approximately 9 times higher than the measured area for the
 thin film.
