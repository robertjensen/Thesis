  abstract = {MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) electron emitters consisting of a
	Si substrate, a SiO(2) tunnel barrier and a Ti (1 nm)/Au(7 nm) top-electrode,
	with an active area of 1 cm(2) have been produced and studied with
	surface science techniques under UHV (ultra high vacuum) conditions
	and their emission characteristics have been investigated. It is
	known, that deposition of an alkali metal on the emitting surface
	lowers the work function and increases the emission efficiency. For
	increasing Cs coverages the surface has been characterized by X-ray
	Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (ISS)
	and work function measurements. Energy spectra of electron emission
	from the devices under an applied bias voltage have been recorded
	for the clean Au surface and for two Cs coverages and simultaneous
	work function curves have been obtained. The electron emission onset
	is seen to appear at the surface work function. A method for cleaning
	the ex situ deposited Au top electrodes to a degree satisfactory
	to surface science studies has been developed, and a threshold for
	oxide damage by low-energy ion exposure between 0.5 and 1 keV has
	been determined. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Ultralarge metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices with an active
	oxide area of 1 cm(2) have been fabricated for use as electron emitters.
	The MOS structures consist of a Si substrate, a SiO(2) tunnel barrier
	(similar to 5 nm), a Ti wetting layer (3-10 angstrom), and a Au top
	layer (5-60 nm). Electron emission from the Au metal layer to vacuum
	is realized from these devices by applying bias voltages larger than
	the work function of the Au layer. The emission is characterized
	for Au layers with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 60 nm nominally.
	The emission efficiency changes from close to 10(-6) to 10(-10).
	The Ti wetting layer is varied from 3 to 10 angstrom which changes
	the emission efficiency by more than one order of magnitude. The
	apparent mean free path of similar to 5 eV electrons in Au is found
	to be 52 angstrom. Deposition of Cs on the Au film increased the
	electron emission efficiency to 4.3% at 4 V by lowering the work
	function. Electron emission under high pressures (up to 2 bars) of
	Ar was observed. (C) 2009 American Vacuum Society. [DOI: 10.1116/1.3079649]},

  abstract = {A comparative analysis of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors
	by capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics
	has been employed to characterize the thickness variations of the
	oxide on different length scales. Ultralarge area (1 cm(2)) ultrathin
	(similar to 5 nm oxide) MOS capacitors have been fabricated to investigate
	their functionality and the variations in oxide thickness, with the
	use as future electron emission devices as the goal. I-V characteristics
	show very low leakage current and excellent agreement to the Fowler-Nordheim
	expression for the current density. Oxide thicknesses have been extracted
	by fitting a model based on Fermi-Dirac statistics to the C-V characteristics.
	By plotting I-V characteristics in a Fowler plot, a measure of the
	thickness of the oxide can be extracted from the tunnel current.
	These apparent thicknesses show a high degree of correlation to thicknesses
	extracted from C-V characteristics on the same MOS capacitors, but
	are systematically lower in value. This offset between the thicknesses
	obtained by C-V characteristics and I-V characteristics is explained
	by an inherent variation of the oxide thickness. Comparison of MOS
	capacitors with different oxide areas ranging from 1 cm(2) to 10
	mu m(2), using the slope from Fowler-Nordheim plots of the I-V characteristics
	as a measure of the oxide thickness, points toward two length scales
	of oxide thickness variations being similar to 1 cm and similar to
	10 mu m, respectively.},
