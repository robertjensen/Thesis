	processing at surfaces (HEFATS) has been developed in terms of inelastic
	electron scattering via negative-molecular-ion shape resonances associated

	a broad band of laser-excited hot electrons and the other a tunable
	narrow band produced by a solid state tunnel junction, are used to
	illustrate the potential of HEFATS in chemical bond breaking as,

  abstract = {The phenomenon of resonance-assisted hot-electron-induced desorption
	of adsorbed atoms or molecules is considered in terms of a semi-classical
	Gaussian wavepacket model. Inelastic scattering of hot electrons,
	forming temporary negative ion adsorbate states, gives rise to enhanced
	energy transfer between the hot electron and the adsorption complex.
	The numerical implications of the wavepacket model, which follows
	in the spirit of past theory of resonance Raman processes, suggests
	a very simple and intuitive analytic representation of the resonance
	desorption process providing a clear connection between the three
	independent timescales of the process and observable quantities such
	as desorption probabilities and rates. The timescales are identified
	as the vibrational period associated with the negative-ion-surface
	bond, that portion of the vibrational period within which desorption
	is possible, and the resonance lifetime of the intermediate negative
	ion state.},

  abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements
	of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor
	is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions
	at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained
	by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass
	spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are
	present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed
	for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design
	is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be
	obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant
	fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface
	areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow
	and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally.
	A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow
	through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in
	the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are
	found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical
	experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction
	zone is around 3 x 10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas
	residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate
	the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum
	thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature
	ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small
	as 15 mu m(2) are conveniently characterized with the device. (C)
