	site of PtO2(110) reacts with CO on the coordinatively unsaturated
	site (CUS) with a negligible barrier; (ii) O-2 adsorbs on the bridge
	site and then interacts with CO on the CUS to form an OO-CO complex;
	(iii) the bond of O-OCO breaks to produce CO2 with a small barrier
	(0.01 eV). The CO oxidation mechanisms on metals and metal oxides
	are rationalized by a simple model: The O-surface bonding determines
	the reactivity on surfaces; it also determines whether the atomic

  abstract = {This article focuses on the microscopic origin of oscillations in
	the rate of CO oxidation at atmospheric pressures on Pt group metals.
	We start by briefly reviewing several existing models for oscillatory
	CO oxidation on such Surfaces at pressures ranging from ultrahigh
	vacuum to several bar. We describe our observations for this reaction
	on Pt(110) and Pd(100) at atmospheric pressures obtained with a scanning
	tunnelling microscope inside a microflow reactor. The combination
	of STM movies and the simultaneously determined partial pressures
	and reaction rate reveals that by switching between a CO-rich flow
	and an O-2-rich flow. and vice versa, we can reversibly oxidize and
	reduce the Pt and Pd surfaces. We find that on both surfaces the
	formation of the oxide, seen in the STM images, is accompanied by
	a stepwise increase in the reaction rate and a change in the reaction
	mechanism. The switching between the reduced metal and the surface
	oxide exhibits significant hysteresis as a function of CO pressure
	and for both Pt and Pd there exists a CO pressure window in which
	both the metal and tile oxide state are stable. This bistabililty
	leads to spontaneous reaction oscillations on Pd( 1 0 0). Under Our
	atmospheric conditions thew oscillations are not due to the 'familiar'
	bistability in Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, in contrast with common
	'wisdom'. Instead, tile high-pressure reaction oscillations reflect
	the periodic switching between the low-reactivity metallic surface
	and the high-reactivity oxide surface, Our results show further that
	effects that are held responsible for low-pressure reaction oscillations
	are not relevant at atmospheric pressure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All

	microscope, which is set up as a flow reactor, to determine simultaneously
	the surface structure and the reactivity of a Pt(110) model catalyst
	at semirealistic reaction conditions for CO oxidation. By controlled
	switching from a CO-rich to an O-2 -rich flow and vice versa, we
	can reversibly oxidize and reduce the platinum surface. The formation
	of the surface oxide has a dramatic effect on the CO2 production
	rate. Our results show that there is a strict one-to-one correspondence
	between the surface structure and the catalytic activity, and suggest
	a reaction mechanism which is not observed at low pressures.},

  abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements
	of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor
	is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions
	at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained
	by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass
	spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are
	present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed
	for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design
	is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be
	obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant
	fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface
	areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow
	and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally.
	A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow
	through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in
	the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are
	found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical
	experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction
	zone is around 3 x 10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas
	residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate
	the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum
	thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature
	ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small
	as 15 mu m(2) are conveniently characterized with the device. (C)

  abstract = {Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to compare the morphologies
	of Ru nanoparticles deposited onto highly-oriented graphite surfaces
	using two different physical vapour deposition methods; (1) pre-formed
	mass-selected Ru nanoparticles with diameters between 2 nm and 15
	nm were soft-landed onto HOPG surfaces using a gas-aggregation source
	and (2) nanoparticles were formed by e-beam evaporation of Ru films
	onto HOPG. The particles generated by the gas-aggregation source
	are round in shape with evidence of facets resolved on the larger
	particles. Annealing these nanoparticles when they are supported
	on unsputtered HOPG resulted in the sintering of smaller nanoparticles,
	while larger particles remained immobile. Nanoparticles deposited
	onto sputtered HOPG surfaces were found to be stable against sintering
	when annealed. The size and shape of nanoparticles deposited by e-beam
	evaporation depend to a large extent on the state of the graphite
	support and the temperature. Ru deposition onto unsputtered HOPG
	is characterised by bimodal growth with large flat particles formed
	on the substrate terraces and smaller diameter particles aligned
	along the substrate steps. Evaporation onto sputtered HOPG results
	in the formation of 2 nm round particles with a narrow size distribution.
	Finally, thermal deposition onto both sputtered and unsputtered HOPG
	at 660 degrees C results in larger particles showing a flat Ru(0
	0 0 1) top facet. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	the time-dependency of the ensemble-averaged particle size and particle

	The MOS structures consist of a Si substrate, a SiO(2) tunnel barrier
	(similar to 5 nm), a Ti wetting layer (3-10 angstrom), and a Au top
	layer (5-60 nm). Electron emission from the Au metal layer to vacuum
	is realized from these devices by applying bias voltages larger than
	the work function of the Au layer. The emission is characterized
	for Au layers with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 60 nm nominally.
	The emission efficiency changes from close to 10(-6) to 10(-10).
	The Ti wetting layer is varied from 3 to 10 angstrom which changes
	the emission efficiency by more than one order of magnitude. The
	apparent mean free path of similar to 5 eV electrons in Au is found
	to be 52 angstrom. Deposition of Cs on the Au film increased the
	electron emission efficiency to 4.3% at 4 V by lowering the work

	(similar to 5 nm oxide) MOS capacitors have been fabricated to investigate
	their functionality and the variations in oxide thickness, with the
	use as future electron emission devices as the goal. I-V characteristics
	show very low leakage current and excellent agreement to the Fowler-Nordheim

	by fitting a model based on Fermi-Dirac statistics to the C-V characteristics.
	By plotting I-V characteristics in a Fowler plot, a measure of the
	thickness of the oxide can be extracted from the tunnel current.
	These apparent thicknesses show a high degree of correlation to thicknesses
	extracted from C-V characteristics on the same MOS capacitors, but
	are systematically lower in value. This offset between the thicknesses
	obtained by C-V characteristics and I-V characteristics is explained
	by an inherent variation of the oxide thickness. Comparison of MOS
	capacitors with different oxide areas ranging from 1 cm(2) to 10
	mu m(2), using the slope from Fowler-Nordheim plots of the I-V characteristics
